    """
    Processes a source directory path, generates a hierarchical tree structure of files,
    and generates a trees structure. If the tree structure has already been
    generated previously, it skips the generation process.

    Parameters:
        source_directory (str): The absolute or relative path to the source directory
                                 containing files to be processed.
        destination_directory (str): The absolute or relative path to the source directory
                                 containing files to be processed.
        generated_source_tree_path (str): The path where the generated file tree structure
                                      will be saved.
        generated_source_json (str): The path where the generated file structure dict
                                      will be saved.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - file_manager (FileManager): An instance of the FileManager class for handling
              file operations in the source and destination directories.
            - tree_structure (TreeStructure): An instance of the TreeStructure class that
              represents the generated file tree.
            - source_tree_dict (dict): A dictionary representation of the file structure in
              the source directory, generated by walking through the source directory recursively.

    Notes:
        - The method may skip tree generation if the tree structure has been previously
          generated, depending on the existence of a specific file or hash check (as indicated
          by the TODO section).
