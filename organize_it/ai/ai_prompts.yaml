  Here is a JSON schema that defines rules for organizing files based on their format, name patterns, or skip conditions. 
  The schema includes properties for source and destination directories, format rules (acceptable file types grouped under 
  directory names), name patterns (regex to match file names and organize them into directories),
  and skip rules (regex to exclude certain files or directories).
  Generate a JSON configuration file that: 
  1. Specifies source and destination paths.
  2. Defines rules for organizing files based on their format (e.g., photo, document) and names (e.g., patterns like "swiss_trip", "project").
  3. Includes optional skip rules for directories or files (if applicable).
  4. Matches the given file structure to their respective destination directories based on these rules.
  The JSON should conform to the schema, categorize files appropriately, and avoid skipping files or directories unnecessarily unless explicitly stated."
  
  Now, using the above schema and and an input tree structure, provide a JSON configuration to organize the files appropriately."
