# OrganizeIt

**OrganizeIt** is a Python-based utility to help users automate the organization of their file system. This tool scans a given directory, organizes files into subdirectories based on their file types, and provides a clean, structured way to manage file systems. Whether you're dealing with a messy Downloads folder or a cluttered workspace, **OrganizeIt** helps sort files quickly and easily.

## Features

- Automatically organizes files into categorized subdirectories (e.g., Images, Documents, Music, etc.).
- Supports custom categorization rules based on file extensions.
- Option to organize files into a hierarchical tree structure for easy navigation.
- Simple, easy-to-use command-line interface.
- Supports recursive file handling for organizing files in nested directories.

## Installation

To use **OrganizeIt**, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prasadkjose/OrganizeIt.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd OrganizeIt
```

### 3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid version conflicts:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 4. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
python3 setup.py install
```
## Testing

Testing is done using pytest. You can find the testing configurations and fixtures in conftest.py. 
#### 1. Run the entire suite. 
```bash
pytest
```
## Usage

### Command Line Interface

The main functionality of **OrganizeIt** can be accessed via the command line. Here’s how you can use the tool:

### 1. Organize Files

To organize files in a directory, run:

```bash
oIt --path /path/to/your/directory
```

- `--path`: The directory whose files you want to organize.

This command will scan the specified directory, organize the files by their types into appropriate subdirectories (such as `Images`, `Documents`, `Videos`, etc.), and move the files accordingly.

### 2. Organize Files with a Custom Directory Structure

You can customize the file organization by defining your own rules for categories. Modify the `config.json` file to suit your needs.

### 3. Dry-Run Mode

If you want to see how **OrganizeIt** would organize the files without actually moving them, use the `--dry-run` flag:

```bash
oIt --dry-run
```

This will display a preview of the changes but will not modify any files.
