# OrganizeIt

**OrganizeIt** is a Python-based utility to help users automate the organization of their file system. This tool scans a given directory, organizes files into subdirectories based on their file types, and provides a clean, structured way to manage file systems. Whether you're dealing with a messy Downloads folder or a cluttered workspace, **OrganizeIt** helps sort files quickly and easily.

## Features

- Automatically organizes files into categorized subdirectories (e.g., Images, Documents, Music, etc.).
- Supports custom categorization rules based on file extensions and file name patterns.
- Option to organize files into a hierarchical tree structure for easy navigation.
- Simple, easy-to-use command-line interface.
- Supports recursive file handling for organizing files in nested directories.
- Supports regex-based exclusion of files and directories, ensuring that system or other location-sensitive files remain unaffected.

## Installation

To use **OrganizeIt**, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prasadkjose/OrganizeIt.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd OrganizeIt
```

### 3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid version conflicts:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 4. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
python3 setup.py install
```
## Testing

Testing is done using pytest. You can find the testing configurations and fixtures in conftest.py. 
#### 1. Run the entire suite. 
```bash
pytest
```
## Usage

### Command Line Interface

The main functionality of **OrganizeIt** can be accessed via the command line. Here’s how you can use the tool:

### 1. Organize Files

To organize files in a directory, run:

```bash
oIt --src /path/to/your/directory --dest /path/to/your/destination
```

- `--src`: The directory whose files you want to organize.
- `--dest`: The detination directory wwhere the organized files will be moved/copied to.
- By default, your files will be copied. To move your files into an organized structure, use the `--move` flag. Please note that this operation is permanent and cannot be undone.


This command will scan the specified source directory, organize the files by their types into appropriate subdirectories (such as `Images`, `Documents`, `Videos`, etc.), and move the files accordingly.

### 2. Organize Files with a Custom Directory Structure

You can customize the file organization by defining your own rules for categories. Modify the `configs/config.json` file to suit your needs.


### 3. Interactive Mode

Interactive mode allows you to guide the CLI tool through a step-by-step process, making it easier to configure settings, choose actions, and preview results before executing operations
If you want to see how **OrganizeIt** would organize the files without actually moving them, use the `-i` flag to run the tool in interactive mode and view the source and resultant trees:

```bash
oIt -i
```

This way, you can display a preview of the result but will not modify any files. You can at any time quit the tool and keep you file structure unaltered. 

If you tech savvy, you can find the generated dictionaries and tree structures in the `.tmp` directory in the project.
